## To do list

* Improve overall performance, code factorization.
* Add a lot of robustness around, to avoid Python exceptions but present clear error messages instead, e.g. when .dat XML file is a corrupt XML.
* Add tests to make sure every option is doing what it's expected to do.
* Add more filtering/cleaning capabilities via input .dat file browsing?
* etc.

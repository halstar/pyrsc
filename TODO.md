## To do list

* Improve overall performance, code factorization.
* Add a lot of robustness around, to avoid Python exceptions but present clear error messages instead, e.g. when .dat XML file is a corrupt XML.
* Improve/replace --del-first-variants/--del-last-variants to possibly select variants against more precise criterias, e.g. if Japan, Europe & USA versions of a ROM are found altogether, only keep Europe version, etc.
* Add tests to make sure every option is doing what it's expected to do.
* Add more filtering/cleaning capabilities via input .dat file browsing?
* Add a lightweight OS-agnostic GUI on top of the command line?
* Turn README how-to to Wiki pages?
* etc.
